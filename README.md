# Isosurface
The isosurface code takes GROMACS MD simulation data to construct a 3D coase-grain density field to find instantaneous isosurfaces in solid-liquid two phase systems. This code has been written for use on biased simulations of bulk ice growth/melting as a way to distinguish true ice-like water from noisy/falsely tagged ice-like water as determined by the CHILL+ order parameter.

A 3D surface for every time frame is generated by using the marching cube algorithm on the density field. The marching cubes output can be interpolated to a fixed space grid for easy visualization in VMD.

The Moller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm is used to tag waters as either being solid or liquid depending which side of the interface the molecule lies on.

This code is also capable of detecting defects in the bulk liquid or ice by identifying all unique, fully-connected graphs from the marching cubes output.

## Installation
From the source code directory run:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Using the code
```python
from isosurface.isosurface import *

df = density_field(...)
```
